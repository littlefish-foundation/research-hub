# littlefish Research

Welcome to littlefish Foundation's research hub.&#x20;

Our research hub covers many areas yet is guided with the perspective of a decentralized organization building on the Cardano blockchain. As such it will be useful primarily to Cardano users, Cardano DAOs, and Cardano builders, but all blockchain users may find something useful here.&#x20;

In this resource you can find information on:

* In depth reviews of DAO Tools building on Cardano: [cardano-dao-tools](cardano-ecosystem/cardano-dao-tools/ "mention")
* Feature comparisons of many Cardano wallets: [cardano-wallets](all-docs/cardano-wallets/ "mention")
* In depth looks at some Cardano DeFi projects: [cardano-defi](all-docs/cardano-defi/ "mention")&#x20;
* Digital work tools that help enable the type of work in DAOs: [remote-work-tools](all-docs/remote-work-tools/ "mention")
* Analysis of many blockchain regulations from token launches to tax implications: [blockchains-and-law](blockchains-and-law/ "mention")
* The state of cross-chain on Cardano: [cardano-cross-chain-solutions](cardano-ecosystem/cardano-cross-chain-solutions/ "mention")
* Case studies of top DAOs, the tools they use, and their governance basics: [dao-case-studies](the-ocean-beyond-cardano/dao-case-studies/ "mention")
* and more ...

## Project Catalyst and littlefish

We are a [Project Catalyst](https://projectcatalyst.io/) powered organization. Project Catalyst is the innovation platform that funds projects building on the Cardano blockchain.

This research hub is prepared as part of three of our funded proposals in Fund 9:&#x20;

1.  **Tools of DAO Work**: Cardano DAO Tools, wallets, and digital work tools that enable the work of DAOs.

2. **Ocean Technologies**: Cross-chain technologies on Cardano, and interesting tech from other blockchains. \
