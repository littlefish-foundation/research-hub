### Opening the Project in Visual Studio Code

Now that you have the project cloned to your local machine, you need to open it in Visual Studio Code (VSCode). VSCode is a powerful editor that provides robust support for TypeScript and React development.

#### Opening the Project

1. Launch Visual Studio Code.
2. Navigate to `File > Open Folder...` from the top menu.
3. Browse to the location where you cloned the repository, select the `boilerplate-e` folder (or whatever you named the folder), and click `Open`. This action will load your project into VSCode.

#### Editing the Hero Section

The hero section of your application is a key part of your user interface, designed to capture users' attention and convey the main message of your application quickly. Hereâ€™s how you can locate and modify this section in the file located at `/components/landing/hero-section.tsx`:

**Locate the Hero Section File**

1. In the VSCode sidebar, navigate to the `components` folder.
2. Drill down to the `landing` sub-folder.
3. Open the file named `hero-section.tsx`.

**Modify the Hero Section**

Once you have the `hero-section.tsx` file open, you can make changes to the text and style as needed:

*   **Change the Headline Text**: Find the `<h1>` tag to modify the main headline of the hero section.

    ```typescript
    <h1 className="bg-gradient-to-br from-white to-white/40 bg-clip-text py-6 text-5xl font-medium leading-none tracking-tighter text-transparent sm:text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl">
      Your New Headline Text Here
    </h1>
    ```
