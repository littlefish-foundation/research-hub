# Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

Before you can start using the Open Source NFT & Wallet Auth Framework for Cardano, you will need to set up an appropriate development environment. A crucial part of this setup is installing Visual Studio Code (VSCode), a popular code editor that offers great support for JavaScript and blockchain development.

#### Installing Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes.

**Step 1: Download VSCode**

1. Go to the [official Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Click on the download link for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Follow the download instructions provided on the site.

**Step 2: Install VSCode**

**For Windows:**

* Run the downloaded installer (`.exe` file).
* Follow the prompts in the Setup Wizard to complete the installation.
* You can accept the default settings, which include adding VSCode to your path, to make it accessible from the command line.

**For macOS:**

* Open the downloaded `.zip` archive.
* Move the `Visual Studio Code` app to your Applications folder.
* Launch it from your Applications folder or Spotlight search.

**For Linux:**

* Depending on the distribution, you can install VSCode using `snap`, `apt`, or `yum`:
  * For Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions: `sudo apt install code`
  * For Fedora/RHEL-based distributions: `sudo yum install code`
  * For any Linux distribution supporting Snap Packages: `sudo snap install --classic code`

**Step 3: Verify Installation**

Once installed, open Visual Studio Code by searching for it in your start menu or applications directory. You can verify that it's correctly installed by opening a new terminal or command prompt and typing:

```bash
code .
```
