# Milestone 1

## Our Project's First Big Step: Milestone 1 Overview

### Introduction

We've reached our first major goal in our project to make logging into websites simpler and more secure using digital tokens (NFTs) on the Cardano blockchain. Let's break down what we've achieved so far!

### What Have We Accomplished?

In this first phase, we focused on setting up the basic features needed for our new authentication system:

* **Connecting Cardano Wallet:** We've made it possible for you to link Cardano wallet (where your digital tokens or NFTs are stored) to your websites easily.
* **Disconnecting Safely:** You can also disconnect wallet, ensuring your information stays private and secure.
* **Displaying Digital Assets:** The system can now display all the digital assets wallet have, like tokens and NFTs, right on the website. This means users can see what you they at a glance. This will lead to using these assets for authentication in the future.

### Why is This Important?

#### Security and Convenience

* **Secure Connections:** By enabling wallet connections, we ensure that your login is as secure as using a key to open a bank vault. Only you have the key, and only you can access your account.
* **Easy Logouts:** Being able to disconnect your wallet means you can feel safe that no one else can access your information once you log out.
* **See Your Assets:** With the ability to access token and NFT information, the user will be able to choose the way they want to access the website, whether a token or an NFT or just the wallet address.

#### A Smoother Online Experience

* **Quick Access:** Connecting wallet lets users access sites quickly—no need to type in passwords or wait for login approvals.
* **Privacy Control:** Users can disconnect anytime to control who sees their information and when they see it.

### What's Next?

With these foundational features set up, we're ready to build more advanced functions that will make the online world even safer and more convenient. We're talking about features that let you use your NFTs as your digital ID across many websites and apps without needing a password.

### Conclusion

We're excited about hitting this first milestone and are geared up for the next steps. By making these basic features robust and user-friendly, we're setting the stage for a revolution in how we all use the internet—simpler, faster, and much more secure.

Thank you for supporting us on this journey. We look forward to making even more progress and sharing it with you!
