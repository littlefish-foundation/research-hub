# Document Quality Levels

There are four levels of quality for the DAO Tools and Ocean Tech documents and a document has to be at least **level 3** in order to be published on the vault. We plan to pay a bonus for **Level 4** documents.

1. Unacceptable Document
2. Document Needs Improvement
3. Good Document
4. Exceptional Document

### Feedback Process

Any Document that is considered **Level 1** will not receive feedback and the writer will be notified that the document has to be at least **Level 2** to be accepted into the feedback process. The reason is that the guideline is clear enough to avoid **Level 1** mistakes.

Any document that is **Level 3** will not receive feedback unless the writer demands it and try to reach **Level 4**. The writer can ask for feedback after the document is graded via Discord.

### Quality Criteria

There are several different quality criteria for the documents. These criteria are divided into Structure and Context.

#### Structure

Structure of the document is very important and they have a significant effect on the quality level of the document. A document should:

* use the organized heading system. The reader should be able to intuitively find the information they want in a document without difficulties.
* Have the proper tags.
* Links have to hidden. For example, we do not want to see [https://www.google.com](https://www.google.com). We want to see [google](https://www.google.com/).
* The syntax of markdown should be used generously. Ordered lists, unordered lists, highlighted text,etc.

#### Context

* The document must explain the researched tool in detail. After reading the document, the reader should have enough information about how the tool works, in what situations the tool is beneficial, what are the pros and cons of the tool.
* For some tools, there might be the need for a "How to Use" part. This part is important for wallet documents or Best Practices documents but for other documents, the writer has the authority to decide including this part.
* Some tools might have unfamiliar concepts. Those concepts has to be explained briefly in sub-headings in the document. If that concept is defined in another document, you can also link to that document.(Linking to other documents is a bonus, we do not require you to read all the previous documents)
* The reader should get the idea of what the document is going to be about when they read just the instruction.

#### Negative Points

The list of quality thresholds that will limit the documents quality level to a certain level. Any of the below will determine the documents quality level no matter the other aspects of the document.

* Wrong Link Format: ==Level 1==
* Wrong Image Format: ==Level 1==
* Writing the entire document with AI tools ==Level 1==
* Using AI generated text without verifying them ==Level 2==
* Messy Headings Usage: ==Level 2==(The writer is suggested not to use our specific template. It is there to give an idea.)
* Missing Tags: ==Level 1==
* Missing External Links: ==Level 1==
* Unclear Concepts/Lack of Explanation: ==Level 2==
* Lack of Detail: ==Level 1== (Writer will be informed)
* Lack of Using Markdown Syntax: ==Level 2==
* Difficult to Understand(Complicated tools will not need this): ==Level 2==
* Insufficient Research: ==Level 2==
* Incomplete Document: ==Level 1==
* Improper publication(All the docs has to published on dework, publishing on Obsidian or Discord will not be accepted): ==Level 1==

#### Bonus Points

Bonus points will determine if the document can be eligible to be ==level 4==. If there is any negative points about the document, the document will be limited to that point until it is fixed even if the document has the bonus points. It is not yet clear if one of the below will make the document ==Level 4== or couple of them will. We will have a more concrete answer to this question in the future.

* Exceptional usage of markdown syntax.
* Usage of some HTML syntax to make the document look even better.
* References to other vault documents about detailed explanations of different concepts.
* The research about the tool is exceptionally detailed.
* A lot of potential new DAO tool suggestions.

The level 1 documents will just receive a simple message that stating the document is unacceptable. Only if there is Lack of Detail, the simple message will state that. The four day feedback process will start even if the document is not eligible to receive feedback, so the writer should try to avoid level 1 to save time.

**Note:** These criteria will be improved and get more detailed as more and more reports get reviewed. Until further notification, some of the criteria might change or ignored when irrelevant.
