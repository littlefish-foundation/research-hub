# littlefish Tools of Work

Here's a list of the tools we use at littlefish Foundation. As of July 20th 2023, this is a comprehensive list of all tools to guide littlefish contributors.

### Communication

#### Discord

Discord is the heart of littlefish foundation. We have our discussions on Discord. We track **actions** done by the community here on Discord. If you want to reach out to other members, Discord is the best way.

### Task Management

#### Markdown

All littlefish documentation is done in **markdown** format. We publish our content mainly on our **Gitbook**, we also have publications on **Obsidian.**

#### Writing Guidance

[document-guide.md](document-guide.md "mention")

[document-quality-levels.md](document-quality-levels.md "mention")

#### Cheat Sheet

We have a detailed cheat sheet in the **Document Guide** document. You can also use [**this**](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to learn and advance your markdown. It's easy once you get a grip, we promise.

#### Collaborative Markdown with HackMD

We use [**Hackmd**](https://hackmd.io/) to collaborate on Markdown documents before publishing on Gitbook or Obsidian. Think of it as Google Doc for MD files.

You can also directly write on **Gitbook**. It is very easy and intuitive but we suggest using **Hackmd** because you can store all the docs you wrote on your own account. Also during the feedback process, comments on Hackmd will be between the writer and the reviewer so it will be private.

#### Dework

We run all our community tasks through [**Dework**](https://app.dework.xyz/littlefish-foundatio). All new tasks are announced on Discord in order to lower the chance of missing new tasks. Members can apply for any task on Dework.

#### Linear

We run core team tasks through **Linear.**

#### **Notion**

We use Notion to keep our internal documentations about proposals tracking and app development.

#### Github

We use github to collaborate our effort on our projects like app development.

### Publication

We use variety of tools to manage our publication. Gitbook and Obsidian for our knowledge sharing, Sobol for our organizations structure and Typefully for our social media accounts.

#### Gitbook

Once you get a good grip on Markdown and want to publish your work, we use [**Gitbook**](https://app.gitbook.com/o/iC4GGLLkuTDPEm22YrOH/s/wNZ1ktYlEZjsG7lczd0u/). Using Gitbook is very simple. It works very similar to Github. All you need to do is click edit to write new articles or edit articles. This edit will create a new branch and until you merge it, you can play with it.

Organizing docs on Gitbook is also very simple. Clinking and dragging documents on the sidebar will do the trick.

#### Sobol

We use Sobol to visualize our groups and teams for newcomers to find their place easily.

#### Obsidian

&#x20;We use Obsidian to mainly post monthly reports. We have migrated our documentation to Gitbook recently because it is much easier for new people to use but for now we still use Obsidian.
