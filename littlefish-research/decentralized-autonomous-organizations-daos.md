# Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)

DAOs are organizations that operate based on rules encoded as computer programs. They promise a new world of organizations that are transparent, voluntary, and controlled by their members. Their financial transactions and rules are maintained on a blockchain for all to observe and verify.

Let's unpack each part to understand DAOs better:

* **Decentralization**: This refers to the lack of a central authority. In a DAO, decisions are made collectively by the organization's members, not by a single leader or a select group of executives.
* **Autonomy**: DAOs operate automatically and independently. They are governed by smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. When their conditions are met, smart contracts execute automatically, removing the need for human interaction to make things happen.
* **Organization**: Despite being decentralized and autonomous, DAOs are still organizations. They have members, they make decisions, and they aim to achieve certain goals.

DAOs are a new way of organizing human activity. They combine the principles of decentralization, autonomy, and organization in a unique way, enabled by blockchain technology. They have the potential to democratize decision-making, increase transparency, and reduce reliance on centralized authorities. &#x20;
