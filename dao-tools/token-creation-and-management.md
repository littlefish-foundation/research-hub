# Token Creation and Management

DAOs usually use tokens to raise initial investments and share their governance with their community. These tokens are used in DAOs governance and have voting power on proposals. Some DAOs also give proposal power to people with more than a specific amount of tokens.

The tools in this category make it easy to create and distribute tokens for DAOs. The distribution of tokens can be done by airdrops or vending machine methods.

* **Airdrop:** This method distributes tokens created to a list of addresses provided by the DAO.
* **Vending Machine:** Members collect tokens from a dApp themselves.

DAOs can also mint their tokens however they choose. For example,

* A DAO can mint all tokens at once
* They can mint tokens gradually
* Tokens can be minted when someone claims them.
