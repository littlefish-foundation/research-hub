# Smart Contract Development

DAOs are made possible by smart contracts. A DAO in control of its smart contracts can unlock all potential benefits of blockchain technology. There is no place for mistakes in Smart Contract development. Smart contracts are immutable, which means when deployed, you can not change a smart contract. This is one of the reasons why smart contracts are safe but it can also have serious consequences. An error in the code of a smart contract can cause loss of funds permanently. Since the smart contract can not be changed, the funds you lost can never be saved.

Smart Contract Development tools aim to help developers deploy better smart contracts. Developers can choose a smart contract they need from the library provided by these tools and edit them according to their specific use cases.
