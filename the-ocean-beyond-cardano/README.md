# The Ocean - beyond Cardano

Beyond Cardano lies a vast ocean of blockchains. Our research covers a tiny slice of it. As an open DAO, we are mostly interested in DAOs and DAO tools, but we have also researched some other technologies on other chains that may be useful for Cardano builders.

Here you will find:

1. Deep dives into top DAOs like Uniswap and AAVE and the tools they use to operate their DAO in [dao-case-studies](dao-case-studies/ "mention")
2. Reviews and analysis of various DAO tools that we found were in frequent use in our [tools-of-the-ocean-report.md](tools-of-the-ocean-report.md "mention")
