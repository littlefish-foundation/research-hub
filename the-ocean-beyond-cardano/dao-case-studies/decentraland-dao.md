# Decentraland DAO

The purpose of this research is to learn more about the DAOs operation, which tools they use to bootstrap the growth of their organization, and how their governance process worksâ€¦

Decentraland is a digital game that was built to mimic reality in 3-D and it is a user-owned, Ethereum-based virtual reality world platform. The users of this platform oversee this digital world via a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).

#### How Decentraland Does Their Governance

**MANA** is the governance utility token for Decentraland DAO. MANA enables users to buy items such as wearables, invest in properties, develop and trade virtual land in decentralized manner.

**How Does Decentraland use Aragon?**

> _**Decentraland uses the battle-tested security of Aragon client to secure and store their DAO treasuries. Decentraland holds off-chain votes for new proposals; when a vote is completed, commitee members uses Aragon to execute those votes.**_

**How Does Decentraland Use Boardroom?**

> **Decentraland uses the Boardroom tool to store updates including treasury, votes, proposals and more.**

_**What more?**_

> Decentraland also leverages **multisig wallet** as part of their DAO tool. The multisig wallet is controlled by the DAO committee (a group of 3 individuals) who have been selected by the community to hold the keys of the multisig wallet. This multisig will enact any passed votes with a binding action, like funding a grant, adding or removing a Poll or implementing governance.

Decentraland governance proposal has 3 steps: each step must reach the required threshold before it can be promoted to the next level.

1. **A Pre-proposal poll**

> This is the first step to get to the final binding governance proposal. Decentraland Polls are known to be non-binding, multiple choice questionnaires used to measure community general opinion. If the Pre-preposal poll amasses enough participation VP (500k VP is the acceptance threshold), then the proposal gets promoted to the next level (Draft proposal.)

2. **A Draft Proposal**

> A Draft proposal presents the community potential policy; it contains a structured discussion format, impact and implementation pathway of the proposal. Once a Draft proposal amasses enough participation (1M VP is the acceptance threshold), it gets promoted to the governance proposal.

3. **A Governance Proposal**

> This is the last step towards governance. It must include details, methods, data and information on how it will be implemented. If it gets 6M VP and the yes option.

### DAO Tools Used By Decentraland DAO

```
1. Aragon: Useful Resources 
```

> **Aragon exists to be a decentralized platform that allows individuals to creat and seamlessly manage organizations on the Ethereum blockchain. Aragon is also an on-chain governance platform for DAOs. With Aragon, DAOs can conduct governance on-chain without writing a singleline of code. DAOs can also customize the votes on Aragon to suit thier needs.**

> **Boardroom is a DAO governance portal that is powered by Boardroom's API, Boardroom is a governance framework agnostic interface that allows DAOs to standardize actions like voting and delegation - with Boardroom, DAO members can participate in distributed governance.**

#### Decentraland DAO Onboarding

Decentraland DAO Onboarding process is very easy; [Click here to join their discord](https://decentraland.org/discord), react to any emoji and that's all. You can start engaging with the community.

One of the easiest ways to earn MANA is by investing in plots (**LAND**) which you can sell later. On Decentraland, you can take advantage of the in-game activities to help you earn MANA. In fact, users can create 3D assets and sell them, lastly, you can get MANA by purchasing on DEX exchanges.
