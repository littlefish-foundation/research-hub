# Uniswap DAO

### Uniswap: What The DAO Does?

This research is centered on Uniswap, weâ€™re looking to get insights into the DAO tools Uniswap uses to perform their operations and to harness the growth of their DAO.

Uniswap is a platform that allow individuals to trade their crypto assets without any involvement of centralized entities. Uniswap, owing its existence to Ethereum blockchain and it's governered by UNI token holders.

#### How Uniswap Does Their Governance

The UNI token can be used by community members to propose and vote on proposals and implement changes to the Uniswap protocol. Uniswap uses their own platform for governance; votes are delegated and cast through the Uniswap's governance portal. They also use off-chain tool like [Snapshot](https://snapshot.page/uniswap) as a voting interface.

> **Snapshot is used by the UNI holders to vote on proposals off-chain after reaching the governance proposal stage. Votes on Snapshot are weighted by the number of UNI delegated to the address used to vote.**

> Discussions takes place on the [Uniswap governance forum](https://app.unswap.org/#/vote), in order for a vote to pass, it must achieve quorum of 4%. If the majority of votes amasses 4%, the proposal is queued in the timelock. The community members have 7 days to cast their votes if the proposal is put forward.

_**how do they use it?**_ Community members must have an account before they can participate in governance - there are 3 preliminary drafts for the Uniswap governance process:

**1. Temperature Check:**

> The temperature check is to determine if there is sufficient will to make changes to the status quorum.

**2. Consensus Check**

> The purpose of the Consensus check is to establish formal discussion around a potential proposal.

**3. Governance Proposal**

>

> This is the final step of the governanace process. The proposal should be based on the winning outcome from the "Consensus Check" and can consist of one or multiple actions. Once the propose function has been called, a two day voting delay begins, after that, a seven day voting will begin.
