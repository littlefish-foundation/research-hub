# Tools of the Ocean Report

### DAO Tools

We have found DAO tools that are used by DAOs on various blockchains during our DAO research. We wrote our own deep dive documents on some of them and gathered resources on others. These tools are categorized into the categories below and as can be seen, most tools fall into multiple categories since lots of tools aim to be all in one tool to create and operate a DAO.

More resources can also be found in the DAO Research Document and the individual DAO Research docs.

### DAO Tools Comparison

Cardano ecosystem currently has a focus on **Governance** and **Smart Contract Development** tools. The reason behind this is, the Cardano ecosystem is fairly new and the main problem the ecosystem has encountered is the entry barrier for new people. These tools aim to bring down the entry barrier for new people to come in. The other reason is developing smart contracts for the Cardano blockchain is hard to master due to the usage of functional programming, people with technical backgrounds need to invest their time to learn and deploy Cardano smart contracts. Tools like Smart Contract Development tools help DAOs to deploy their own smart contracts easily.

DAO tools on other blockchains especially Ethereum tools mostly focus on **Treasury Management** and **Membership and Reputation** tools. These tools are show us that DAOs on other chains experience the issues of community management, treasury managemnent and reward sharing. The **Governance** tools on other chains also have a difference to the Cardano tools of the same category and it is the way they approach voting. Gas fees on some blockchains like Ethereum can be significantly higher than Cardano. DAOs on cardano can have the luxury of ignoring these fees but Ethereum DAOs need to be very careful on what they vote on. As it is expleined in more detail in the DAO Research section, DAOs on Ethereum have implemented voting mechanisms that try to eliminate poor and unpopular proposals to have on-chain votes to control the cost of voting.

Another important thing to mention is, there are not many DAO tools on Cardano. We have conducted one of the most comprehensive researches on Cardano DAO tools and currently there are in total 12 tools that fit into the category of DAO Tools. On Ethereum, there are lots of DAO tools, we have found many but it is impossible to give the exact number of tools.

### DAO Research

This research is about entering popular DAOs and learning about the tools they use, and their DAO operations.

### Interesting Projects

While we conducted our research on other chains, we encountered some projects that don't have any equivalent on Cardano blockchain. We have decided to include interesting projects into our report.

#### COTI

COTI is a blockchain solution that aims payments faster, cheaper, more secure, and more personalized. What differentiates COTI from other blockchains is its use of Proof of Trust consensus mechanism. COTI also has a cross-chain bridge which connects COTI to Ethereum.

#### Ensuro

Ensuro is a blockchain protocol that provides capital coverage for insurance risks. It is a licensed (re)insurer on blockchain.&#x20;

#### Kleros

Kleros is a decentralized dispute resolution protocol for use on smart contract platforms, which has been implemented on Ethereum. It acts as a decentralized third party capable of providing decisions on the correct result when applying a set of rules to questions ranging from simple to highly complex.
