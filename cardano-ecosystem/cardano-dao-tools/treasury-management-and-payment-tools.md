### Multi-Signature Wallets

One of the popular tools for treasury management is multi-signature wallets. The name wallet can be misleading because multi-signature or multi-sig wallets resemble safes more than wallets. These wallets require more than one key in order to access assets in them like bank safes.

A DAO is a decentralized organization but if their assets are kept in a regular wallet address, that is centralized. Any person in possession of keys to that address is in full control of the entire DAOs treasury. Multisig wallets offer decentralization of this power among certain members of the community and they also offer the ability to lock assets before or after a certain date.

### Project Management Tools

Another type of DAO tools falls into this category are Project Management Tools.  these tools track tasks done by members and process payments automatically according to tasks done by the community of a DAO.
