# Cardano Cross-Chain Solutions

## What is Cross-Chain

Cross-chain refers to the interoperability between different blockchain networks, allowing assets and data to be transferred seamlessly from one blockchain to another. This is crucial for enhancing the utility and scalability of blockchain applications. Various technologies like atomic swaps, oracles, sidechains, and blockchain bridges facilitate cross-chain transactions.&#x20;

See our articles that cover cross-chain concepts in detail:

## Cross-chain in Cardano

### Bridges

There are several bridges currently available on Cardano fulfilling a range of services. See below full articles covering each:

[milkomeda.md](../../all-docs/what-is-cross-chain/blockchain-bridges/milkomeda.md "mention")

[milkomeda-protocol.md](../../all-docs/what-is-cross-chain/blockchain-bridges/milkomeda-protocol.md "mention")

[indigo-protocol.md](../../all-docs/cardano-defi/indigo-protocol.md "mention")

[wanchain.md](../../all-docs/what-is-cross-chain/blockchain-bridges/wanchain.md "mention")

[celer-and-nufi-bridges.md](../../all-docs/what-is-cross-chain/blockchain-bridges/celer-and-nufi-bridges.md "mention")

Some tools are available yet not under further development:

### Oracles

Charli3 is the standalone Oracle that is currently available for Cardano builders. See the article for an indepth look.

[charli3.md](../../all-docs/what-is-cross-chain/blockchain-oracles/charli3.md "mention")

Yet there are other projects that are currently under development to deploy oracles on Cardano:
