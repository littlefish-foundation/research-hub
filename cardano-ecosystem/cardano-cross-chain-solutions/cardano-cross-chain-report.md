# Cardano Cross-Chain Report

**Author:** _Emir Olgun_

**Date:** _18 October 2023_

### Introduction

We in the littlefish Foundation have conducted one of the most comprehensive researches about Cross-Chain capabilities in Cardano blockchain. This report will present **What is Cross-Chain**, **Cross-Chain Concepts**, and **Cross-Chain Services** that are currently operational and ongoing projects.

### What is Cross-Chain

Cross-chain refers to the interoperability between different blockchain networks, allowing assets and data to be transferred seamlessly from one blockchain to another. This is crucial for enhancing the utility and scalability of blockchain applications. Various technologies like atomic swaps, oracles, sidechains, and blockchain bridges facilitate cross-chain transactions. The goal is to create a more interconnected and efficient ecosystem, where one is not limited by the capabilities or assets and services of a single blockchain. For some of these concepts we have written documents as they are complex technologies.

### Cross-Chain Services on Cardano

We also have done research on all the Cardano cross-chain tools we found. Some of these projects are ready to be used, some are still in development and one tool called Microchains was functional but is dead.

#### Cross-Chain Bridges

These are the operational cross-chain bridges on Cardano:&#x20;

Here are cross-chain bridges that are not operational:

#### Cardano Oracles

Here are the operational Cardano oracles:

Here are projects that announced they are working on Cardano but not yet deployed an oracle:

#### Sidechains

### Writers Remarks

As of October 2023, there are not many services for Cardano cross-chain but with new services expected to come online, it looks promising. There are currently couple of available cross-chain bridges, one oracle, one atomic swap, and one expected sidechain. Even though the only oracle solution on Cardano, Charli3, does not offer  much services, it has a strong and promising technical infrastructure and it definately has the potential to become dominant oracle service for Cardano.
