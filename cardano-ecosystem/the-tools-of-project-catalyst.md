# The Tools of Project Catalyst

Project Catalyst is Cardano blockchain’s driving force. It is a community controlled decentralized fund that provides funding to projects that build on the Cardano blockchain.

As of October 2023, there have been 10 funding rounds, with more than 1460 proposals approved, with a total of $64M. The latest fund had a budget of 50M ADA, or around $12.5M. All this, and it only started back in 2020.

Funded proposals include a wide variety of projects: hardcore blockchain infrastructure, community spaces, decentralized applications, media channels to spread Cardano, DAO tools, and a whole lot more.

### Participating in Catalyst

The best part of Project Catalyst is that anybody can participate. If you have a great idea and you would like to get funding, you can propose on [Ideascale](https://cardano.ideascale.com/). Once the proposals are finalized, it is the turn of the [Community Reviewers](https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/catalyst-basics/how-to-participate-in-community-reviews). Then any ADA holder can [participate](https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005679386-Catalyst-registration-and-voting-guide) in the votes to make the decision for who gets funded. Once its all said and done, Challenge Teams guide the winning teams through the future steps as the teams get their funding and are expected to deliver on their promises.

That’s only the official process. There’s a whole lot more underneath it all in the multitudes of communities that have popped up around Project Catalyst.

#### Who should use this tool?

**Potential Proposers**

Project Catalyst is **very competitive.** If you want to get your project funded, you need to do the work. Jump into the Explorer and look for patterns on what gets funded. What type of proposals are looked down upon? Which challenges are more competitive?

**Looking to find a team, co-founder, a job**

Catalyst is the house of many great minds. If you’re looking for a team to join that aligns with your personal vision, with what you want to achieve, this is a great tool to find those people.

**Investigators**

Being a decentralized innovation fund means there will be a lot of people looking to take advantage. There are many projects that don’t get completed, or waste away the money, or promise but deliver very little.

It’s critical the system creates antibodies to resist against these types of projects. If you’re looking to become such an antibody then this is the tool for any Coffeezilla types looking to find those bad apples.

**Voters**

Use the voter tool to find the best projects to vote for. The tool allows you to search based on Quick Pitches with videos, proposals from teams with completed proposals, opensource projects, and a bunch of other interesting filtering capabilities to help you find the hidden gems.
