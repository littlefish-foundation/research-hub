# Cardano Ecosystem

Below you'll find our research on the Cardano ecosystem covering

* Cardano wallet reviews and comparisons
* DAO Tools building on Cardano if you want to make a DAO in Cardano
* DeFi dApps
* Cross-chain solutions like bridges and oracles
* Project Catalyst, the innovation engine of Cardano

### Wallets

Cardano wallets are the most essential way to be in the Cardano Ecosystem. A user keeps their assets in them and they use their wallets to connect to different tools on the blockchain like dApps.

We have reviewed the most used Cardano light wallets and here are all of them.

### DAO Tools

DAO tools are software applications built on blockchain technology that facilitate the creation and management of DAOs. DAOs are organizations that are fully decentralized and autonomous, with decisions made through a consensus process on the blockchain. DAO tools can include platforms for creating DAOs (like Summon Platform or Clarity Protocol), and blockchain platforms (like Ethereum or Cardano).

### Decentralized Finance

Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is a revolutionary movement in the financial industry that leverages blockchain technology to disintermediate traditional financial intermediaries. DeFi tools are the various applications, platforms, and protocols that facilitate this new form of finance. They are designed to recreate and improve upon the financial systems we have today but in a decentralized, open, and transparent manner.

### Cross-Chain Solutions

Cross-chain is the interconnection of two or more entirely different blockchains. It allows the transfer of assets and data between different blockchains.

### Project Catalyst

Catalyst is a $50M+ open innovation fund. Anybody with an idea to further the goals of Cardano may apply for funding and pursue their idea. Read about the tools that make it go round and how to get involved here: [the-tools-of-project-catalyst.md](the-tools-of-project-catalyst.md "mention")
