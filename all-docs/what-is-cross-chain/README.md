Cross-chain refers to the interoperability between different blockchain networks, allowing assets and data to be transferred seamlessly from one blockchain to another. This is crucial for enhancing the utility and scalability of blockchain applications. Various technologies like atomic swaps, wrapped tokens, and blockchain bridges facilitate cross-chain transactions. The goal is to create a more interconnected and efficient ecosystem, where you're not limited by the capabilities or assets of a single blockchain.
