# Zoom Best Practices

### Introduction

This document is a collection point of curated best practices for facilitating zoom meetings. It can include anything that would help a Zoom / Online meeting organizer, but the scope might creep to general online facilitation best practices. For beginners mostly, but advanced tips could be good. This document is open for collaborative editing.

From mastering basic functionalities like muting participants and screen sharing to understanding the nuances of participant engagement and security, this guide covers it all. We also delve into the ethics of online facilitation, emphasizing respect for participant choices and ensuring a safe and inclusive environment for all attendees.

Zoom Basic Tips

* Mute
* Screen Sharing
* Breakout room
* Spotlight
* Agenda on paper
* Zoom Chat: Be careful
* Tell the parameters BEFORE you open the mic
* Show Constant support

Activity

* Explore the options as a moderator
* Find the noise-maker and mute them. Quick!
* Share a portion of the screen and pause it there. (Share the computer sound)
* Create a breakout room and assign participants
* Move yourself among the rooms and check if everything is alright

**Other suggestions:**

* Have at least 2 facilitators - one to keep an eye on the chat and/or let people in, and one to facilitate discussion
* Welcome people via the chat if they come in late
* Consider how you want to manage settings for people coming in (waiting room? settings so that mic is off when entering? etc)
* Personally, I would say: If you’re running a Zoom session, don’t keep asking people to put their camera on “so I can see your wuvly face” or whatever (I was in a non-Catalyst meeting recently where the facilitator kept doing that, and I thought it was well out of order!) Maybe the guidance could say “Be conscious of all the reasons a person might choose to keep their camera off, and accept their choice without comment” or something…
* For your own security and privacy if you share screen in a meeting - have the window that you are sharing set to full screen so nothing is visible behind it; have it in a window on its own with no other tabs open; hide your menu bar; etc
* If your meeting is being documented, give both audio and video files to the documenter if you can

### Why DAOs Should Use Zoom

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) represent a paradigm shift in organizational structures, emphasizing transparency, decentralized decision-making, and community-driven initiatives. In this evolving landscape, Zoom emerges as an invaluable tool, bridging the geographical and temporal divides inherent in decentralized entities. The platform facilitates real-time communication, enabling members from across the globe to converge, discuss, and make collective decisions. Its features, from breakout rooms to screen sharing, ensures that complex topics can be dissected, visual aids can be presented, and smaller groups can engage in focused discussions, mirroring the multifaceted nature of DAO operations.

Moreover, Zoom's recording capabilities play a pivotal role in maintaining the transparency that DAOs champion. Meetings can be documented and archived, ensuring that members who couldn't attend in real-time can review discussions, and decisions made are always accessible for future reference. This archival feature, combined with Zoom's ease of use and scalability, makes it an indispensable tool for DAOs that strive for inclusivity, transparency, and effective collaboration.
