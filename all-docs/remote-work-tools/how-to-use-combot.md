# How to use ComBot

It is with a sense of immense excitement that I’m able to write about this revolutionary Discord Bot known as ComBot. We all know how daunting it can be to manage and moderate a community of hundreds and thousands of people. In recent years, we’ve witnessed a massive surge of interest for Discord Bots. In this article, we’ll get a clearer insight into one of the novel Discord Bots in the world.

> As you read the paragraphs below, we will explain what problems this tool solves, why DAOs have that problem, and whether they recommend using it..

### What Is ComBot?

ComBot is one of the worlds most advanced community management tools for Discord. Some of the amazing features of this tool include, but not limited to analytics, moderation, spam protection, triggers, levels & XP system, report system, and reputation system.

### What problems The Tool Solves?

_**Here are the reasons why DAOs need this too**_

Unlike other community management services out there, ComBot is no different! Should in case you don’t know, ComBot is one of the most actively used Discord community management services.

1. With ComBot, you’d never miss anything noteworthy. More so, the analytics dashboard allows Discord community managers and administrators to easily learn more about how users are interacting with their groups, and insights that revolve around their channel.
2. People tend to take advantage of everything. That being said, community managers and administrators can sleep safe while Combot protects their group from advertisements, spam, and excessive flooding. This tool can automatically warn violators and also restrict new users according to the Discord channel policies.
3. The aim of Combot is to ensure that its users enjoy a handful of moderation services whilst enabling them to focus entirely on your business. Discord channel administrators can leverage the administrative commands to execute actions seamlessly; The admittance of ComBot into Discord will bring sanity to your channels, thereby allowing your community members to report bad messages or content to group administrators.

### How to Use

1- You can invite the bot to your server from [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client\_id=652938911642943498\&permissions=537259088\&scope=bot%20applications.commands). You can also see the bot's support page from [this link](https://discord.gg/VdT64GM)

2- After adding the bot you can use the command `/create` and give a specific name to the connection. This will create the connection for you. This connection name should be unique and maximum 16 characters with only alpha-numerical ones.

3- After creating the connection you have to select it by `/select connection-name`

4- Now that you have created and selected the connection you can add a channel to this connection. For this you have to use `/connect` command. When you write this command it will prompt you to choose a channel from your server. This will connect your channel to the connection.

You can connect to this channel from any other server simply by repeating the steps above except the second one. Any channel you connect to the same connection will send the messages to each other.

Please note that there is 10 minute cooldown between connection creations and one person can only create two connections. For more freedom with the bot you can visit the bot's [patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/join/soupcreations)

### Why DAOs Encounter These Problems?

I’ve seen DAO communities where stalkers come to dump pornographic images and also try to advertise or spam other members of the community. A typical example of a DAO that experienced this act is DIA DAO — an open-source, cross-chain oracle platform for Web3 and, also providing customizable and transparent data feeds for smart contracts.

DAOs encounter this problem probably because they still rely on human beings to handle the moderating side of things; truth be told, community managers or administrators can not deliver like these bots — the bots are always online and active to kick against indiscipline while the human moderators can’t be available round the clock to check all the activities in their Discord.

### Why Is This Tool Important For DAOs

Since ComBot came into existence, it has piqued the interest of many people, especially community managers and administrators across different channels like Discord. Different organizations, especially decentralized ones use this tool in their Discord; this tool is recommended by DAOs because it allows them to:

* DAOs can use comBot to always plan ahead using scheduled and recurring announcements; it also allows for the addition of automatic answers to frequently asked questions in the community, and to also assign reputation points to DAO members and more!
* Inactivity in a group is a red flag and it can cause members to leave; I could recall a while back, I left quite a number of discord channels because it almost seems as if nothing is happening there; ComBot can help DAOs to transform their community from being disinterested into a lively community with greater expand opportunities to constantly engage existing participants and draw in new ones.
