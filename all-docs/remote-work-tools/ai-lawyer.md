### Introduction

AI-Lawyer is a tool to provide legal services to ease up legal processing by document comparison, summarization, and legal document generation. It is developed to almost completely surpass the need for an attorney.

### How does it work?

At first sight, it is a fairly sophisticated artificial intelligence tool, which may be a very inexpensive and user-friendly way to reduce the need for legal counseling. Several legal procedures can be simplified for users who are not experts in the area.

AI-Lawyer is enabled to analyze various topics within large sets of legal documents and report potential legal problems for the users, simplify legal terminology for non-experts, and ease monitoring the legal terms of other websites. Also, AI-Lawyer promises automation in low-value legal duties.

#### Scope

AI-Lawyer shines where the tedious processes are being streamlined. Although it has grand claims about its capabilities, it does not claim that it will replace real-time lawyers. Most interestingly, it offers an AI-powered chatbot that gives the feeling of a legal conversation on small legal issues such as contract clauses or taxes with a counselor. It provides legal advice, answers legal questions in real-time and drafts legal documents.

### Conclusion

AI Lawyer seems to be a great leap in the field of artificial intelligence and it is definitely worth checking up on its progress through time. Legal counseling may be quite costly and sometimes quite a daunting task to attend by regular individuals. Its cost-effective structure and easy-to-use interface are promising features to admire. However, it might be better suited for legal professionals rather than non-expert individuals. The website is already up and running which allowed me to try out some of the feauters. Users may already use the chat-bot feature without upgrading their account to premium. Within this free feauture, given questions were answered in a concise and easy to read format by the artificial intelligence. For instance, I asked a question about wrongful termination in a workplace and AI was able to procure an answer in a matter of seconds with a quite useful roadmap. Depending on users' legal predicament, legal chatbot and other features can be used easily. Finally, with such a tool, lawyers can increase their productivity and efficiency in a blink of an eye while focusing on the matters that require the expert touch.

#### Its place in DAOs

One should be mindful of how recently this tool was developed. The amount of info regarding its mechanics and scope is not sufficient to utter a definitive view about it. Nevertheless, from the preliminary research, it can be said that it has a potential for the DAOs. It is beneficial for DAOs to keep an eye out for the AI-Lawyer. As it claims, it offers fast, easy, and accessible legal services for the digital world. Which may be utilized in a way that may benefit DAO projects before their execution. Inherently it does not adhere to business hours and it can be reached from all around the globe. Which makes it a perfect tool for DOAs to utilize its legal insight.
