#### What time to post

Occasionally, it's hard to tell what is the best time to post content on social media; according to my research, time is an important factor to consider when putting content out there for your audience. Posting content when your audience are online could potentially help your content reach a maximum peak. Almost everyone checks their phones when they wake up from sleep, and during closing hours at the office too, people check their phones to see what they have missed during the day. So, 7am and 5pm are perfect for sharing content on social media.
