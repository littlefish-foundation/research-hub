## As a community member&#x20;

Discord is a busy place. For those who use it, there are some common problems that can make it feel a bit too much:

* **Too Many Channels**: Discord lets you join many chat rooms, called channels. But with so many chats happening at once, it's easy to get lost.
* **So Many Alerts**: Every time someone sends a message or mentions you, you get a notification. When you're part of many chats, these alerts can pile up and become distracting.
* **Being Everywhere at Once**: Some people join many different groups on Discord. But keeping up with all of them? That's hard. It feels like you're trying to be in many places at once.
* **Worried About Missing Out**: In busy chat rooms, messages come in fast. If you're not always online, you might feel like you're missing out on important chats or news.
* **Too Much Information**: People share a lot on Discord – links, pictures, news, and more. Finding what you need among all that can be like looking for a lost item in a messy room.

Here are our guides to help you through these problems.&#x20;

## As a server admin

Server administrators shoulder the responsibility of ensuring seamless communication, especially when fostering inter-community collaborations. The right tools can make this task significantly more manageable.&#x20;

Being in charge of a Discord server for DAOs comes with its own set of challenges:

* **Connecting Communities**: With so many separate servers, getting them to talk to each other isn't straightforward. How do you make sure communities can collaborate easily?
* **Too Many Alerts**: Admins get pinged for a lot. From new members joining to important announcements, the notifications can pile up and become overwhelming.
* **Organizing Events**: Planning regular events to keep the community engaged is a big task. Making sure everyone knows when they are and that they run smoothly is another challenge.
* **Time Zone Troubles**: With members from all over the world, figuring out a time that works for everyone can be tricky.
* **Tokenizing Communities**: We are DAOs, we want our tokens to show our reputation, our bonds with our communities. How do we do this?
