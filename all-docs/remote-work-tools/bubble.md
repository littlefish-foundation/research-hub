### Introduction

Bubble.io is no longer a new phenomenon.If you don't already know what Bubble is, you're in the right page - In this blueprint, you'll get to know more about the tool, how it works, limitations of the tool, pros and cons, as well as how to build.

To begin with, bubble exists to be one of the most powerful no-code development platforms that allows users to program, design, host, and scale web applications.

Bubble is very simple to use; once you understand the working environment, you can begin to fix and create things within a matter of minutes. This tool is suitable for individuals with no prior experience in writing codes - that being said; Bubble allows you to create stunning web applications without writing a single line of code. Bubble has eliminated the need for coding background by providing a flexible editor for developers to create their web apps without any hurdles.

#### How does it work?

With Bubble, one can easily create web apps even if they do not have any experience. The applications developed by Bubble can be easily accessed via a computer web browser, tablet, or phone.

In Bubble, all your applications have a separate database, with this, all Bubble developers can create their accounts to save data, and retrieve data when the need arises. Bubble has one of the most efficient editors amongst other no-code builders, the possibility of what Bubble can do is almost endless as they're are so many features embedded within the program which allows Bubblers to build exactly what they desire.

It might interest you to know that Bubble supports the following features:

1. Developers can create user accounts easily.
2. Bubble allows for the saving, modification, deleting, and retrieval of data without any hassle.
3. Bubble has real-time updates; I built some applications a while back with several no-code platforms but some of them lack the real-time update feature which I wasn't really happy about.
4. Bubble makes it possible to not only enable developers from all walks of life to connect any kind of external services to their application; anything from API (Application Programming Interface,) to payment system integration to authentication providers - just to mention a few, all is possible within Bubble.
5. Bubble allows developers to create responsive applications - which means your apps can fit well in different screen sizes.

#### How it is used:

1. So firstly, if you do not already have a bubble.io account, you'll need to create one. You can sign up with your Google Account.
2. Once you're inside Bubble, hover over your mouse to "Create an App."

3. Select a unique name for your app; then hit the Create App Button - in the meantime; you can also go to Bubble marketplace to choose from a variety of ready-made templates to ease your workflow. With a Bubble template, you don't necessarily need to build your apps from scratch.

4. The next page should display the name of your application; you can change it anytime you want though. Followed by the font style of the app, your app color, and app plugins which adds more functionality to your app. Once you're done, click "Get Started."

5. Now, it's time to start customizing your app to your own needs and preferences.The design tab allows you to add any kind of element in your app; you can see my own example. I added a button (CREED WRITERS - BEST AI WRITING TOOL.) In Bubble, "Workflow" will help add functionalities to your app. For example, if someone clicks the button, what should happen next? If this happens, what happens next? You can use this as a template to create your dream applications.

#### Limitations of Bubble

1. One major downside of Bubble is that developers cannot create native apps for both IOS and Android operating systems.
2. Bubble does not allow developers to run Python programs or other scripts.
3. There are UI templates and inspiration available on ui8.com for fresh Bubble developers who may not like the interface and cannot create games using Bubble.
4. The Bubble frontend performance has a poor loading speed; users would've to wait a long time before the index page/home page loads - it can be so annoying!
5. According to my research, I discovered that thousands of people complain about Bubble servers. A few developers have specific instructions from their clients about where their data is stored; Truth be told, only if you can break the bank by purchasing the most prestigious Bubble pricing tier - your app databases are stored in the United States.

#### Pros/Advantages of Bubble

1. Bubble is quite economical to be frank with you. Hiring a developer to get the job done seems very expensive. Say you have an idea you want to share with the world but, you don't have money to fund the idea or you have no prior experience in coding, you can simply use Bubble to achieve your goal before your idea becomes outdated.
2. Bubble is very agile in the sense that developers can easily create applications within a short period of time without having to code anything from scratch. Bubble has done all the groundwork for you; all you simply need to do is drag and drop elements where you want them to be, and it's that simple.
3. Bubble allows for the creation of versatile products. Users can easily make changes to their apps as well as updating the apps with new features without having to break the bank by hiring a developer or spending hours writing codes. On top of that, Bubble has an enhanced productivity level which ensures smooth workflows while your apps are being built.

#### Cons/Disadvantages of Bubble

1. Bubblehas has limitations

Although there are thousands of things we could actually do with Bubble, this idea totally depends on our mindset - firstly, we need to convey the idea then would know whether Bubble is the right tool to use. For instance, if you're planning on making a project that involves creating a gaming app, I'm so sorry - Bubble can't do that for you. And, in some cases you might want to combine other third-party services to get the most of Bubble.

2. Limited Customisation Options

For a no-code tool like Bubble, there are a limited number of things you could actually do. Although Bubble's comes with a handful of templates, and design tools, sometimes you might just want to be unique, but the option is available for all Bubble developers.

3. Anyone looking to use Bubble to its full potential must dedicate time to learn the Bubble interface, else you might just get overwhelmed with the entire interface because it contains so many different panels. To help level up your Bubble skill, you can simply visit blogs or follow video classes that other Bubble developers have published anywhere online.
