# Manage Miro Boards

## Managing Miro Boards

On a decentralized workspace, more often than not Miro Boards tend to get a little confusing. How many times have you come across a situation like this: "_Yesterday during the zoom meeting I was able to edit this board, but today I can't._"

Well, this and other similar situations have to do with the **Role** that you have been assigned.

***

### Roles in Miro

The **Visitor** role. You know you are a **Visitor**, when you are invited to collaborate on a Miro board via a public link. In such case, you have access to edit the board but just for that instance (one-off session). Trying it again later won't have the same outcome. Being a visitor, doesn't require you to be registered.

The **Guest** role. You know you are a **Guest**, when you are invited via email. In this case, you can only access the board that you have been invited to. This role allows you to return whenever you want and still be able to edit the board, unless the team administrator revokes your access. _Note: You won't be able to see the board you are invited to on the dashboard, unless you **star** it._

The **Member** role. **Members** have full access on all the boards shared with them in a team. If you are a member, you can create your own board and content.

### Managing Information Effectively

When you first register on Miro, it allows you to create your own team. Having your personal team will help you organize boards in a more efficient way. In this section I will describe some practices you can apply to increase the efficiency of your boards.

**If you registered on Miro through an invitation link to a team and you are using a free plan, this option will not be available. However, if you exit from all teams you are a member of, Miro will ask you to create "My Team". After creating your team, you may ask the administrators of other teams to re-invite you.**

Sometimes a Miro board may be very disorganized and because of that you may have a hard time understaning the material and the flow of information. Consider the following scenario:

**You want to add some new information in a board, but before doing that you have to read and understand "already there" disorganised information.**

An effective way to overcome this can be addressed by:

**1. Duplicate the board in question.**

**2. Move the duplicated board to your personal team.**

**3. Delete all parts that are irrelevant to your work.**



**4. Reorganize the information as it suits you best.**

*   When reorganizing try to implement the following:

    * Create frames out of existing objects. When your components are saved as frames you can iterate through them much faster in order to find what you are looking for. When you open the sidebar, you can see the preview of all frames located in the board. In this way, you don't have to go through the entire board.

    * Give objects or frames a name that starts with "#". For example, if an object's name is "#Actions", when you search #Actions on the search box, you will be redirected to that object immediately.

    * _If you think you did a good job, show your work to the administrator of the original board, and ask if replacing the current version with your new and improved one is possible. This way the entire team may benefit from your work._



**5. After absorbing the available information, go on and create the object you wated to contribute as a frame.**

* When you are done you can copy the frames containing your work and paste them to the original board.&#x20;
