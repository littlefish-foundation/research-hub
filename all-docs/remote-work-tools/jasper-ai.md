### Introduction

Jasper AI is an ai copywriter and it writes content surprisingly well. It can be used to write social media content, articles, e-commerce description, and product features, e-mails, and even simplified text that aims to explain something to a child. Jasper can also improve already written content, get the key points from a provided text, and detect your tone from the text you have written. As can be seen, Jasper AI is an extremely versatile tool.

### How to Use

Jasper AI is a paid service but you can try it for free for five days and cancel the subscription with no fees. If you want to continue using it, the Boss Mode, which is like an individual version, starting price is 59 American dollars for 50,000 words per month and it can go up to 600 American dollars for 700,000 words. If you want even higher words per month, they offer custom pricing. The business version has a custom plan and pricing policy which requires the custormer to contact the Jasper team. There is also a chrome extension for Jasper.

The main page has a tutorial for using the tool. You can try to generate a blog post, a paragraph, a caption for social media, etc. Also, there is an ai chat. You can directly ask for what you want to do and how you want to do it and it works very well.

This is the Templates page. Here you can find different services Jasper offers and generate what you want easily. For example, when you ask for a tweet, you write what it is about and the tone of voice. The tone of voice is not a list of choices, you can write whatever you want there and you can combine different tones like ‚ÄúExcited but serious‚Äù.

When I tried to generate a tweet about Gimbalabs announcing their PPBL course in 2023, Jasper generated the following tweets.

**The Prompt:** Updates about Gimbalabs' 43rd weekly report which includes announcement of the first PPBL course in 2023. Gimbalabs is a DAO whose purpose is to educate people about Cardano Blockchain and train technical people for smart contract development and web3 development. Mainly people learn how to run a Cardano Node on their computers, programming languages of Haskell and Plutus.

**Results:**

As you can see, it is not perfect, you need to adjust some mistakes like ‚ÄúCardanO‚Äù but it has the potential to seriously save time.

Another example is trying the Tone Detector mode.

**Prompt:** Agora aims to solve an important blocker for most people which is setting up the infrastructure of the on-chain organizations. The Agora Library can be very useful for new and existing DAOs and can be used by other projects for more detailed and tailored governing infrastructures.

**Result:**

* The tone of this content is helpful and informative.
* Informative and helpful.

### How DAOs Can Use Jasper

Jasper copywriter aims to shorten the process of writing and unblock writer‚Äôs block. DAOs generate internal documents, write proposals and most importantly, DAOs need to use social media effectively. Jasper is designed to be of use for these tasks. I believe this tool is one of the best there is and it should be used by the DAOs even though the pricing is a little bit high.

### Conclusion

Jasper is a very useful tool. The team behind Jasper seems very active and they offer a lot of documents and sessions about how to effectively use Jasper. This tool is very versatile and very effective. I believe the price of 49 USD is worth it.
