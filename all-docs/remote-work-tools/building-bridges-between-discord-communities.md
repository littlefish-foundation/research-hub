# Building Bridges Between Discord Communities

***

**The Problem**

In the decentralized world of DAOs, collaboration is not just a buzzword—it's a necessity. As these autonomous organizations strive to reshape industries and redefine community-driven initiatives, the power of inter-DAO collaboration becomes evident. Yet, a significant challenge looms large: how can DAO communities establish healthy communication channels with each other? For the purposes of this article, our focus is on Discord, the main communication hub for DAOs all around.

DAOs, by their very nature, are independent entities, each with its unique goals, culture, and ethos. When two or more DAOs come together, the potential is immense. They can pool resources, share knowledge, embark on joint projects, and collectively address challenges that might be insurmountable for a single entity.

However, the path to such synergy is fraught with communication barriers. Discord, while a popular platform for community engagement, isn't inherently structured to foster deep, meaningful interactions between different communities. The challenge isn't just about navigating a bustling platform; it's about creating spaces where multiple communities can come together, understand each other, and work towards shared objectives.

For us at littlefish Foundation, this wasn't a theoretical challenge—it was a lived experience. As we sought to foster active communication and co-projects with other communities like Social Design Academy, c4c, and others, we grappled with the intricacies of bridging diverse groups. The goal was clear: to move beyond superficial interactions and establish channels that encouraged genuine collaboration between our community and others.

**What didn't work**

Recognizing the limitations of Discord's in-built features, we embarked on a quest to find tools that could bridge the communication chasm.&#x20;

We experimented with several tools that didn't quite get the job done.

* [Connecty](https://top.gg/tr/bot/683004822202351927) - While promising, we found its setup process cumbersome and its bot connection unstable.
* [Disnet](https://top.gg/bot/666792286348247040) - Again, the bot connection left much to be desired.
* [Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/discord/integrations/discord/62302/copy-new-discord-channel-messages-to-another-channel) - Zapier is an amazing tool, but a tool that has much more than what we need, and the requirement for full administrator access makes it difficult for other server admins to accept it.

**The solutions that worked**

These tools we found were the best fit to solve the challenge of inter server communication.

*   **ComBot**: A versatile tool designed to enhance inter-server communication.&#x20;

* **Multi Server Chat**: Tailored for communities like ours, seeking to foster meaningful interactions across servers.\
