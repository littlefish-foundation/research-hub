## OTTER.AI

Welcome to yet another exciting article that discusses about one of the most novel AI (artificial intelligence) note taking software. **Otter.AI** isn't just one person's opinion – it's a smart application that works under the control of AI and machine learning.

Come to think of it, the era of taking notes in meetings now seems to be like a far-fetched idea! During the heart of the pandemic, the way we all worked looked different; organizational meetings have looked a bit different.

After a few short years, we’ve seen a drastic change in communication, which basically means that the way we collaborate and interact with people is going to be different - from conference rooms to round tables, Zoom and Google Hangouts really played an important role in that sphere.

Trying to take notes in meetings takes a lot of time and on the other hand, it causes to follow the meeting inefficiently. Otter.ai is a speech-to-text transcription and translation application using artificial intelligence and machine learning. You can use it to take notes at your meetings and interviews, capture your thoughts and ideas, and transcribe your existing recordings.

### 1. How Do I Start Using ?
