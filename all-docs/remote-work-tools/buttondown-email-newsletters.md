### Obsidian Integration

Installing the ButtonDown plugin

API Key can be found here: [https://buttondown.email/settings#api](https://buttondown.email/settings#api)

Unfortunately, this plugin does not seem to be maintained, and it does not work on my install of Obsidian 1.0, there is an error in the console. Looking on the github page, this code has not been updated in 8 months, so this is not a valid path.

However, copying Obsidian Markdown to Buttondown works great.

### Sharing the newsletter

After sending an email, you have options offered to promote the newsletter on social email or share the link.&#x20;
