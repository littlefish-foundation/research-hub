### Introduction

The era of note-taking during interviews or meetings is now a thing of the past; thankfully, there is a powerful game-changer that helps you do all that.

In this write-up, we'll elaborate on Noty.ai – an AI tool built to make your online meetings and interviews run smoothly without having to worry about jotting down important sections.

We've all been there! I could recall, early this year I was preparing to start my internship; I did a couple of interviews – sometimes, the hiring managers would tell me to write down some essential things. I'd be honest with you, taking notes with Zoom or Microsoft Team is just not so convenient.

#### What does Noty.ai do

Noty.ai was designed to help users automatically generate summaries by transcribing Google Meet, and Zoom calls. The most interesting part of this AI tool is that meeting transcription works in real-time – transcription happens without much delay. Equally, if you probably missed any caption or highlights, the meeting transcription feature automatically saves them even whether you're at the meeting or not.

#### Where Can Noty.ai Be Used

Noty.ai plays a vital role in our daily living, and I'd be sharing that with you. Here are some of the best use cases of this software.
