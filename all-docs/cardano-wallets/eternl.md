### Staking

* Since Eternl is developed by TITANstaking and AHLNET, it is encouraged to delegate your stakes in those pools. However, it is possible to stake in any pool of your choice.

* Each account in your wallet (max. 24) can be delegated to different staking pools.
* There is a concept "Staking Vault", that is cancelled due to low interest of ADA holders. You can read details in "FAQ" page under "Staking Vault" tab.
