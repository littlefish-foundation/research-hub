1. Delegate your Stake

Note that your **total balance** in your wallet that is used, will be delegated to the pool. But you will be able to send/receive even though your total balance is staked.

You can use the button "DEREGISTER" to undelegate your staked ADA from the pool.

When you DEREGISTER, your 2 ADA deposit will be returned.

If you only want to change the pool you are staking, you can click the "Change" button, which will redirect you to pool search pop-up, which we have used in the 4th step.

Staking process links (delegation) your wallet address to the selected pool and creates a unique staking address. To be able to stake to multiple pools, you have to use different wallet addresses.

Think before you act, because every time you change your pool, register or de-register, you will be paying the transaction amount.

### Voting

In order to participate in voting, first you need to delegate your ADA to a pool. **500** ADA is the minimum amount required to be able to register and participate in voting.
