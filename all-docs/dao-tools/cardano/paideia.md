# Paideia

People at Paideia are developing a DAO management tool called Paideia. Paideia supports creating a DAO, token distribution, treasury management and much more. It is being developed for Ergo and Cardano blockchain currently. The platform is currently running on Ergo blockchain and is being developed for Cardano. We contacted the team behind Paideia and they currently cannot give a certain date for the Cardano launch but they are working on the tool. They also plan to have the same or very similar properties on Cardano blockchain as they have on Ergo. I have done the deep dive on the Paideia White Paper and the [Paideia App](https://app.paideia.im).

### What Does It Do?

Paideia is a web app designed for DAO management. It is an **open-source** project. Users need to connect their wallet in order to use it. Paideia supports the features below:

**Governance Management**

DAOs can choose the style of governance they want and create tokens and distribute them with their community.

**Proposals**

Members with the authority can create proposals.

**Voting**

Voting can be done on Paideia and and the type of voting can be chosen. The types of voting are:

* **Token-based quorum voting:** In this system members with governance tokens can participate in the vote. The admin can choose a quorum for the vote. For example, if the quorum is set to 50%, the minimum positive votes have to be at least 50% of the all votes.
* **Quadratic Voting:** This method uses calculation to optimize voting power. In this method number of participants have more effect than voters with power. It can be used to prevent the domination of whales.
* **Single Choice Voting:** Voters can only allocate their entire voting power to only one choice.
* **Approval Voting:** Voters can choose multiple choices and their each choice has equal weight.
* **Ranked Choice Voting:** Voters can have multiple choice but they have to rank these choices. First choice has the highest weight, second and third have less.
* **Weighted Voting:** Voters can spread their voting power across multiple choices.

**Token Creation/Issuance**

DAOs can mint and distribute tokens according to their preferred mechanism.(Direct sale, dutch auction, airdrops et cetera)

**Tokenomics**

DAOs can control the number of tokens that are distributed or withheld for specific groups, their vesting schedules and visualize them by graphs and tables.

**Staking Tools**

Paideia supports staking of the tokens.

**Reputation System**

Paideia supports building of reputation and validation information. It can also incentivize people by giving bonuses.

**Treasury Management**

Paideia allows proposals that include treasury staking, providing liquidity to earn LP revenue. It also allows other smart contract interactions through DAO management panel.

### Paideia Platform

Paideia has a very user friendly user interface which is very informative at the same time. Platform has a **Dashboard** for the DAO. that page gives brief information about the DAO, Token stats, active proposals and latest activity. There are also pages for **Proposals**, **Financials**, **Members**, **Activity**, and **DAO Config**.

The proposals page displays all the proposals the DAO has generated with a search function that can show different categories of proposals.

Financials page shows information about the token of the DAO. A lot of different information can be found on this page like token price change and market cap. There is also graphs for tracking the price changes of the token.

Members page shows the members of the DAO as the name suggests.

Activity page shows comments, proposals, transactions and staking. This page can be very informative to catch up with the DAO.

The DAO Config page is the most important page. Here the admins of the DAO choose the voting mechanism of their choice, adjust the parameters for the voting system. The design of the DAOs page can also be manipulated here. By design, I mean colours and logo. The DAO can also be terminated in this page.

### Road Map

Paideia seems to be on track on their milestones so far. For 2023, some of their plans are:

* Implementation of cross-chain functionality.
* Creation of side-chain and stand-alone DAO management tool outside of the Paideia website.

### Discussion

Paideia has created a very useful platform for DAO management and activity. This tool has great features already and has a huge potential.Even though, Paideia is not on Cardano yet, the platform should be followed closely. As mentioned before, we contacted the team at Paideia and they plan to implement same of very similar functionality to their Cardano platform. Also they announced the work on Cardano on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/paideiadao/status/1641204419856601088?s=61\&t=JezDl-a0KNCzZ17UI188qg) on March 30, 2023.

Both Cardano and Ergo smart contracts are written in functional programming languages. These kind of languages are quite difficult and not widespread. I believe tools like Paideia are of utmost importance for the popularity of blockchains increase of the number of DAOs. There are projects like Clarity Protocol and Summon Platform on Cardano for the DAO governing and management problem and more projects will definitely bring down the entry barrier for new DAOs.
