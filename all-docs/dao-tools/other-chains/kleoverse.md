* references to other channels (Twitter, Discord, Telegram, Website, Email, Github, StackOverflow, Lens)
* current work status (hiring, looking for work, providing service)

### Comparison to DeWork

* It seems that you need an ETH address and one of the supported wallets to participate.
* A lot of listed organizations don't look very well maintained, including the Kleoverse DAO, that means no jobs and no bounties available .
* As a contributor you can apply to a bounty, but you don't have an overview of the other bounties of a project that are in progress or in review like in DeWork.
* I tried to create a DAO but I get a server error so I cannot test something like bounty creation.
* When you apply to a bounty you have to give your Discord name and some details why you should be chosen for this bounty and links to your previous work and expertise.
