### Introduction

**Swae** is a cutting-edge platform that offers an all-in-one decision making and governance tool, designed to empower the next generation of Web3 DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) communities. **Swae** provides a user-friendly interface that streamlines the decision-making process, making it easier for DAOs to manage their operations and foster collaborative decision making among their members. With **Swae**, DAO communities can make informed decisions, manage their resources more effectively, and build a more transparent and decentralized future. Swae is part of the broader SingularityNET ecosystem.

To learn more about DAOs, please check out my other article [summon-platform.md](../cardano/summon-platform.md "mention") where I explain everything in detail.

Initially, Swae was not explicitly engineered for DAOs or blockchain technology; rather, it was crafted to cater to conventional organizations. A noteworthy feature of Swae is its ability to facilitate the ascension of promising ideas from the grassroots level to the upper echelons of management. Consequently, this empowers leadership with well-prepared concepts primed for execution.

The procedure for sifting through promising ideas and presenting them to the leadership for assessment consists of six stages:

1. Formulate a mission and establish performance indicators.
2. Gather proposals through crowdsourcing.
3. Refine the pitches utilizing artificial intelligence (NLP and GPT-3) and collective editing.
4. Employ crowd voting to filter the most viable ideas.
5. The most compelling concepts naturally rise to the forefront for decision-making.
6. Leadership is supplied with well-prepared proposals, primed for implementation.
