<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/coord.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Coordinape is an application that brings a solution by approaching the traditional action and reward system with a different approach. Generally, the payment system in DAOs is controlled by an authorized persons. Those people distribute the determined payment amounts to their members on the basis of their contributions. Coordinape changes this traditional structure, allowing team members formed for a task to distribute the determined payments to each other.

### 1. How it Works ?

#### Create Circles

Circles are group of contributors within a DAO, they have a budget to distribute among themselves.

#### Create an Epoch

Epoch is the period when team members interpret each other and distribute the determined budget to each other on a specified date. Each Circle member receives a specific quantity of GIVE tokens at the beginning of the Epoch . As a compensation for the value they add to the Circle, members distribute tokens to one another throughout the Epoch.

**\* Opt Out**

Team member who is already paid via other channels and does not want to be get paid during the epoch

**\* Opt In**

Team member who wants to receive GIVE\* during epoch period.

* GIVE is a non-pecuniary token, created to represent transactions within the Coordinape.

### 2. CoVaults

You can avoid exporting the Coordinape CSV in order to carry out batch payments using third-party programs by using Coordinape Vaults. Coordinape offers a panel where admins can track and manage their team's and send multiple transactions with ease.

* CoVaults offers 2 payment methods, fixed and action based.
* Vault only supports ERC-20 tokens, DAI or USDC
