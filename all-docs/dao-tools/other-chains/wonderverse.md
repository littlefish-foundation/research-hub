### Introduction

If you do not already know what Wonderverse is, here's a glimpse of what the tool brings to Web3 space; Wonderverse is one of the groundbreaking native DAO tool that combines a handful of critical pieces for managing any kind of participation in a DAO.

Additionally, Wonderverse exists to build a community-led platform that'll nurture collaboration between organizations, and contributors - in the meantime, allowing users to own a share of equity.

#### How does it works?

Having known what Wonderverse is, let's dive into how the DAO tool works. So, firstly, when Wonderverse is launched, it will become a place where people can seamlessly manage, and track their DAO activities without any hurdles. With Wonderverse, users and DAOs can integrate Crypto into the project management - that's interesting right?

#### Comparison between Wonderverse and other platforms(Dework)

Currently, Wonder tokens are being used to reward contributors on Wonder - while on other platforms like Dework, DAOs have their own personal token. Additionally, even if your DAO doesn't have its own token, users can still create tasks, and attach points to them. This might be a downside of Wonderverse over other platforms like Dework.

Wonderverse is still in its early stage, it cannot integrate with some DAO tools - but, with other DAO tools like Dework, you can integrate easily. You can import projects from Notion, Trello, Github etc.

#### How to use wonderverse:

If Wonderverse is completely foreign to you, there's no problem - here's how you can use Wonderverse without any hurdles. Anyone looking to revolutionize the world with his/her idea can launch Web3 project with Wonderverse.

1. Input your name and description:

Give your DAO a unique name, and tell the world what you have to offer them in the description box. Just so you know; the name you input will be the name of your organization - be sure it is unique though. Your name will be displayed at the top of your workspace, and basically elsewhere in Wonderverse. In the description box, tell the world why you exist, what value you'll bring to the world as well as what your organization's goals are - this information will be displayed in the header of your Wonderverse workspace, and it will be visible to all Wonder users.

2. Progressively, you'll need a nice looking logo and header image to help your own brand stand out from the crowd. Your header image could be a means of brand awareness or even for adverts - it's up to you anyway.
3. Select Organization Category:

Categories is another way of describing what your brand is all about, it's more like a niche - this way, users will have a peek of what your organization is focused on. With your categories, you will be able to pair your DAO with several contributors; just to mention a few.

4. Connect Discord:

Discord is no longer a new phenomenon; it is one of the tools used by decentralized autonomous organizations for managing their DAO activities - with Discord, you can import roles alongside other cool stuff.

5. Review: Take a minute to review all the information you've put down and that's all; pretty simpler than you can ever imagine. Don't worry! You can still edit your workspace once it has been created.

#### What are the possible problems to encounter when using Wonderverse instead of dework?

There is still a problem with the automation and integration of DAO tasks on Wonderverse; For instance, when DAO posts a task, and it is claimed by a contributor - it doesn't integrate with other tools the DAO uses - examples, Discord or Notion.

#### Conclusion

Wonderverse's mission is to make the world a global village while creating opportunities for many people to have a better life. With Wonderverse, be sure that your project will be a success in the market.
