&#x20;Charmverse is a cloud-based project management tool that enables teams to collaborate on tasks and projects in real-time. The tool is designed to help teams stay organized, track progress, and improve productivity.

Tag lines for Charmverse - "**Web3 operations platform - tasks, docs, bounties and voting**". And, "**Onboard and engage web3 communities**"

Charmverse includes a **member directory** feature that allows users to easily search and sort through members of the community based on different criteria, such as role or activity level. The directory also includes role-based access, which ensures that sensitive information and permissions are only accessible to authorized users.

Charmverse has the ability to **create proposals**. Users can create proposals for any aspect of the Space, and other users can comment on and vote for or against the proposal. This allows for community input and engagement, ensuring that the Space evolves to meet the needs of its users. Charmverse also integrates with Snapshot, a popular voting and governance platform, which further enhances the platform's democratic decision-making process. Finally, users receive notifications when appropriate, ensuring that they are aware of important updates and changes to the proposals important to them.

The **Bounty feature** lets any task be turned into a bounty. Users can set bounties in different EVM currencies [Youtube explainer of Bounties 2min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uooady3sL0I)

A **forum feature** that allows users to tag and filter discussions based on specific topics. The forum also supports threaded conversations, which means users can reply to specific messages within a discussion thread. Additionally, users can vote on the usefulness of a particular message by clicking on either the up or down arrow next to it. This feature allows users to prioritize the most relevant and valuable information within a discussion.

A **task board feature** that allows users to post bounties for specific tasks. This feature supports crypto payments, which means users can offer a cryptocurrency reward to anyone who completes a task.

### ‚öñÔ∏èComparison to Dework. Why should we or should we not switch to this platform

Writing proposals is not available on Dework. Dework does have the community suggestions area, but it is not equivalent.

Charmverse organizes its community through Spaces, which are similar to the "DAO" in Dework and the "Server" in Discord. Your account profile follows you across different Spaces, allowing for a consistent experience across the platform.

There is an interactive onboarding document with quality explainer videos under 2 minutes long.

Charmverse has several features that make onboarding new users simple and seamless. Users can invite others to the platform using invite links, which can be shared via email, social media, or other communication channels. Additionally, Charmverse has a token-gate feature that requires users to hold a certain crypto assets in their wallet in order to access the platform. Onboarding to Charm is smoother than Dework, in my opinion.

Charmverse makes it easy to import roles from Discord, which can save time and effort when setting up roles and permissions for different users.

Charmverse has a unique way of navigating its folder structure that's worth mentioning. On the left column of the interface, you'll find a familiar file tree layout similar to what you'd see in Windows OS or IDEs like VSCode. This is where you can organize your projects and functional groups, with an interface that resembles a standard file and folder structure. The metaphor used is intuitive and easy to understand.

Charmverse is open source. Dework is not.

### ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Possible Problems

Resistance to change and learning curve are common problems when switching software. My opinion is that the learning curve will not be very steep because both tools have a similar feature set and the UX of Charmverse is less clunky than Dework. If you understand Dework, then it will be no problem to pick up Charmverse.

Charmverse might have some overlapping features with other tools used by most community organizations. Charmverse can replace Dework for project and task management. But what about the calendar, forum and knowledge base features?

While its UX is intuitive, the block document editing will require the most adjustment, in my opinion. However, I believe that we will be able to adapt quickly to this new way of working should we choose to switch to Charmverse.

### ‚ùìQuestions and Notesü§î:

‚ùìIs seems like this might be a replacement for Discord with the forums feature? Does Charmverse integrate with discord?

‚ùìToken-gating is interesting. I wonder how hard it would be to use a Cardano coin. Perhaps Milkomeda could help.

ü§î An app update happened while using it. I get the feeling that it is being actively developed. Which is easily verified on [Github](https://github.com/charmverse).

‚ùìWhat is Gnosis Safe? It is an available integration in the governance section of Charmverse. Now simply called, [Safe](https://safe.global/). It is a "decentralized custody protocol and collective asset management platform on Ethereum and the EVM"
